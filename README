This is a Log Search and Summarizer tool. It indexes the given log file and show important patterns in the log file. You can also search for patterns of your interest.


REQUIREMENTS:
1. Perl
2. Apache (to execute cgi script)
3. OS: Linux (Tested on Fedora Core 5-7, compatible with other Unixes).
4. Disk Space: Twice the size of log file is required.

NO INSTALLING. HOW TO RUN:


$ perl Monitor.pl yourlogfile

This takes time to execute.

Now a new folder 'yourlogfile_data' will be created. Edit cgi-bin/CONFIG file, by giving the path to this folder. eg: /home/suman/LogSum/yourlogfile_data/
Remember, don't forget the '/' at the end of the path(It is compulsory).

Now move the 'CONFIG' and 'LogSummarizer.cgi' in 'cgi-bin' folder to /var/www/cgi-bin/ folder(needs root permission). If you are not a root user, and can host cgi scripts through public_html, copy those two files to ~/public_html/cgi-bin/.

Now type http://localhost/cgi-bin/LogSummarizer.cgi in any browser. Further, you will enjoy your log browsing.
